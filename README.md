Welcome to the BeansBot!

This is an open source repo for a discord bot that can be used for playing music, and whatever other features I decide to add.

Feel free to clone the repo, and make your own bot from the code. If you have any new features you would like added feel free to create a ticket.
If you have cloned the repo and added a bug fix, or added a new feature push it up and Ill review it.

Currently you can queue music by song name! Just type in the song name!

You can also queue up a Spotify playlist! (Only playlists are supported atm) Format: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/{playlistID}
